# SwiftPlaygrounds

My testing oriented playgrounds

## CustomParserPlayground

Contains some methods and classes for date time recognition, based on [regular expressions](https://www.regular-expressions.info).
Main part of the project inspired by [SwiftyChrono](https://github.com/quire-io/SwiftyChrono) project. Methods and classes changed
for my own purposes and mostly simplified. 

### Changed contents:

## AttributedStrings 

My play with main concepts of attributed texts in swift. Learning based on [NSAttributedString by example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/113/nsattributedstring-by-example)
